    "For instance, if you want to concatenate two lists list1 and list2, you can use the += operator instead of the + operator. The + operator creates a new list with the combined elements of both lists, whereas the += operator modifies the first list by adding the elements of the second list to it. This is faster because it avoids the creation of a new list and the deallocation of the original one.\n",

A generator is an iterator that produces a stream of values using the yield keyword instead of returning them all at once like a normal function.

Instead, it returns a generator object, which can be used to iterate through the values produced by the generator function. The values are generated on-the-fly as the iterator is iterated over, rather than all at once."

The function can then be resumed from where it left off by calling it again, and it will continue executing from where it yielded. This allows the function to generate a sequence of values lazily, on demand, rather than generating them all upfront and storing them in memory."

This can be particularly useful when working with large datasets or when dealing with an infinite stream of data, as it allows us to conserve memory and avoid crashing our program due to memory limitations. Additionally, generators can improve the efficiency of our code by allowing us to work with one value at a time, rather than having to load and process all of the values in a list or other data structure at once."
