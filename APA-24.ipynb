    "Q1. Is it permissible to use several import statements to import the same module? What would the goal be? Can you think of a situation where it would be beneficial?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it is permissible to use several import statements to import the same module in Python. The goal is to use the functions or variables from the module in different parts of the code without having to rewrite the import statement each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "One situation where it would be beneficial is when working with large modules or packages with many sub-modules. In such cases, it can be useful to import only the sub-modules that are needed for a particular part of the code to reduce memory usage and improve performance. By importing the same module multiple times with different import statements, each part of the code can import only the required sub-modules, leading to more efficient and modular code."

    "Q3. Circular importing, such as when two modules import each other, can lead to dependencies and bugs that aren&#39;t visible. How can you go about creating a program that avoids mutual importing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Circular importing is a common issue that can cause problems such as infinite loops and errors in Python. To avoid circular importing and the resulting dependencies and bugs, you can follow these guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid importing modules that import the current module. This means that if module A imports module B, and module B also imports module A, the two modules will be in a circular import. One way to avoid this is to refactor the code so that the common functionality is moved to a new module that can be imported by both A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use lazy imports where possible. This means that modules should be imported only when they are needed, rather than being imported at the beginning of the program. This can be achieved using techniques such as lazy loading and dynamic importing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use dependency injection. Dependency injection is a design pattern that involves passing dependencies to a function or module as arguments, rather than relying on importing them directly. This approach can help to reduce the complexity of the code and make it easier to manage dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use absolute imports. When importing modules, it is a good practice to use absolute imports, which are relative to the root of the project, rather than relative imports, which are relative to the current module. This can help to avoid confusion and reduce the likelihood of circular importing."

    "\n",
    "In Python, _ _all_ _ is a special variable that is used to define a list of public objects that a module provides. This variable is used as a way to control what names should be imported when a user does a from module import * statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of _ _all_ _ is to provide a clean and consistent interface for users of the module. By specifying _ _all_ _, the module developer can control what objects should be considered part of the module's public API, and which ones should be kept private. This helps to avoid namespace collisions and makes it easier for users to understand how to use the module.\n",
