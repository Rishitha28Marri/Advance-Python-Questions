    "Q1. Define the relationship between a class and its instances. Is it a one-to-one or a one-to-many partnership, for example?\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, while an instance is a specific occurrence of a class. The relationship between a class and its instances is one-to-many, as multiple instances can be created from the same class. Each instance of a class has its own set of attributes and methods, but they all share the same structure and behavior defined by the class."

An instance consists of all the data held in the class's attributes, as well as any data that is specific to that particular instance. In other words, the instance variables hold data that is unique to each instance of the class. This means that the data held in an instance is not shared with other instances of the same class, and can only be accessed through that specific instance."

    "\n",
    "In Python, a method is a function that is bound to a class and can access that class's data. It is called using an instance of the class. A regular function, on the other hand, is not bound to any specific class or instance and is called by its name. Methods can modify an object's state, while a function only operates on the arguments passed to it. In other words, a method is a function that is specific to a class and can be called on an instance of that class to perform some action or return some value."

    "Q6. How much encapsulation (making instance or class variables private) does Python support?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, encapsulation is supported to a certain extent through the use of naming conventions. By convention, variables that are intended to be private should be prefixed with a double underscore, which makes them harder to access directly from outside the class. However, it is still possible to access them using name mangling (e.g., _ClassName__private_var). In addition, Python does not enforce encapsulation like other object-oriented programming languages such as Java or C++. Ultimately, the extent of encapsulation in Python depends on the programmer's discipline in following naming conventions and not accessing private variables from outside the class."

An instance variable, on the other hand, is a variable that is unique to each instance of a class. It is defined inside the constructor method (__init__) and is prefixed with self.\n",

    "The __add__ and __radd__ methods are both used for adding objects together using the + operator, but they differ in the order of the operands.\n",

    "The __add__ method is called when the + operator is applied to an instance of a class, and it takes one argument: the other operand of the + operator. For example, if a is an instance of a class that has defined the __add__ method, then a + 2 will call the __add__ method with the argument 2.\n",

    "\n",
    "A reflection method in Python is a method that starts with the double underscore (__) and ends with another double underscore. It provides a way to customize or override the default behavior of built-in operations in Python. For example, the __str__ method is used to define the string representation of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might need to use a reflection method when you want to customize the behavior of an operation for instances of your class. For example, you might want to define a custom __eq__ method to compare instances of your class based on some specific attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not all operations require a reflection method to be defined. For example, the __len__ method can be used to return the length of an object, but if it's not defined, Python will try to use the built-in len function instead. Similarly, if the __str__ method is not defined, Python will try to use __repr__ instead."

To do this, define the __init__ method in the subclass with the same name as the parent class's __init__ method. You can then customize the subclass's __init__ method by adding additional parameters or by calling the parent class's __init__ method with super() and adding additional code to it. For example:\n",
