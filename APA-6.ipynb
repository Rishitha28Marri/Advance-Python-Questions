    "Q1. Describe three applications for exception processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception processing is a powerful mechanism in Python that allows you to handle runtime errors gracefully, recover from them, and continue the execution of the program. Here are three common applications of exception processing in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Error handling: Exception processing is primarily used for handling errors and exceptions that occur during program execution. When an error occurs, Python generates an exception object that contains information about the error, such as the type of error and the line number where it occurred. You can catch these exceptions using the try-except statement and handle them appropriately, such as by printing an error message or logging the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input validation: Another application of exception processing is input validation. You can use exception processing to detect and handle invalid inputs to your program, such as invalid user inputs or incorrect file formats. For example, you could use a try-except block to catch and handle errors that occur when reading a file or parsing input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource management: Exception processing can also be used for managing resources in your program, such as file handles, network connections, or database connections. When you use resources, it is important to make sure that they are properly closed or released when they are no longer needed, even if an exception occurs. You can use the try-finally statement to ensure that resources are properly closed or released, even if an exception occurs. Alternatively, you can use the with statement to automatically handle resource management for you, which is known as the \"context management protocol\"."

    "Q2. What happens if you don&#39;t do something extra to treat an exception?\n",
    "\n",
    "If an exception is not handled by the program, it will result in an error message and the program will terminate. The error message will display the exception type, the line number of the code where the exception occurred, and a traceback of the call stack at the point where the exception was raised. This can make it difficult to identify the root cause of the problem and fix it. Therefore, it is important to handle exceptions properly in programs to ensure robustness and reliability."

    "Q3. What are your options for recovering from an exception in your script?\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is raised in a Python script, there are several ways to recover from it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle the exception using a try-except block: You can wrap the code that might raise an exception in a try block and handle the exception in an except block. This allows you to gracefully recover from the exception and continue executing the rest of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reraise the exception: You can also choose to reraise the exception by using the \"raise\" keyword inside the except block. This allows you to catch the exception at a higher level in the call stack, or to allow a different exception handler to deal with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the finally block: You can use a finally block to run some cleanup code regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. This is useful for closing files, releasing resources, or performing other cleanup tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the with statement: The with statement is used to ensure that a resource is acquired and released properly. This is particularly useful for working with files, sockets, and other resources that need to be explicitly closed or released."

   "source": [
    "Q4. Describe two methods for triggering exceptions in your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raise an exception explicitly: In Python, you can explicitly raise an exception using the raise keyword followed by the type of the exception you want to raise. \n",
    "This will cause the program to immediately stop execution and print a traceback showing where the exception was raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Call a function that raises an exception: Many built-in functions and methods in Python will raise exceptions if they encounter errors. For example, if you try to open a file that doesn't exist using the built-in open() function, it will raise a FileNotFoundError exception. You can also write your own functions that raise exceptions in certain situations to signal errors or unexpected behavior to calling code."

    "\n",
    "The finally block: This block of code is always executed, whether or not an exception occurred. It is typically used for cleanup operations that must be performed, such as closing files or network connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The atexit module: This module provides a simple interface for registering functions to be called when the interpreter is about to exit. This is useful for performing final cleanup operations, such as saving data to disk or releasing system resources. The atexit module provides the register() function, which takes a function object as its argument and registers it to be called when the interpreter is about to exit."
