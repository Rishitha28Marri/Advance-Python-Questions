    "Q1. What is the difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__?\n",
    "\n",
    "Both __getattr__ and __getattribute__ are special methods in Python that are used to define attribute access behavior for objects. However, there is an important difference between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "__getattr__(self, name): This method is called when an attempt is made to access an attribute that does not exist on an object. It takes a single argument, name, which is the name of the attribute being accessed. If the attribute exists, __getattr__ is not called. Instead, the value of the attribute is returned directly. If __getattr__ is not defined, attempts to access non-existent attributes will raise an AttributeError.\n",
    "\n",
    "__getattribute__(self, name): This method is called every time an attribute is accessed on an object, whether the attribute exists or not. It takes a single argument, name, which is the name of the attribute being accessed. If the attribute exists, __getattribute__ is responsible for returning its value. If the attribute does not exist, __getattribute__ will raise an AttributeError.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, __getattr__ is only called when an attribute is not found using normal attribute lookup, while __getattribute__ is called for every attribute access, regardless of whether the attribute exists or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "This difference has some important implications for how the two methods are used. __getattr__ is typically used to define fallback behavior for missing attributes, such as generating them on-the-fly or redirecting to another object. __getattribute__, on the other hand, is used to define custom behavior for all attribute accesses, such as attribute validation or access control.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to use these methods carefully, as they can have significant performance implications and can potentially create infinite recursion if implemented incorrectly."

    "2. What is the difference between properties and descriptors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties and descriptors are both Python language features that allow you to customize attribute access and behavior for classes. While they share some similarities, there are important differences between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties: A property is a special kind of attribute that is accessed like a regular attribute, but whose value is computed on-the-fly using a getter method. Properties are defined using the @property decorator, which indicates that the decorated method should be used as the getter for the property. Properties are read-only by default, but can also be defined with a setter method to allow write access. Properties are often used to provide a cleaner, more Pythonic interface to an object's internal state, by hiding the implementation details behind a simpler interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptors: A descriptor is a more general mechanism for defining custom attribute access behavior in Python. A descriptor is an object that defines one or more of the following methods: __get__, __set__, and __delete__. When an attribute is accessed on an object that has a descriptor, the descriptor's methods are called instead of the object's own attribute access methods. Descriptors can be used to implement more complex attribute behavior than is possible with properties, such as automatic type conversion, attribute validation, and more. Descriptors can be attached to a class or to individual instances of a class, and can be reused across multiple classes."

    "__getattr__: This method is called when an attribute is accessed on an object and is not found through the usual attribute lookup process. It takes a single argument, the name of the attribute being accessed, and returns the attribute value or raises an AttributeError. __getattr__ can be used to define fallback behavior for missing attributes, but it can also be slow because it is called every time an attribute is accessed.\n",

It takes a single argument, the name of the attribute being accessed, and returns the attribute value or raises an AttributeError. __getattribute__ can be used to define custom behavior for all attribute accesses, but it must be implemented carefully to avoid infinite recursion and other issues.\n",
