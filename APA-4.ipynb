    "Q3. In a class, how do you intercept slice operations?\n",
    "\n",
    "To intercept slice operations in a Python class, you can define the __getitem__() method with a slice object as its argument. The __getitem__() method is called when an item is retrieved from an object using square brackets [].\n",
    "\n",
    "The __getitem__() method takes one argument, which can be either an integer index or a slice object. A slice object represents a range of indices, and it has three attributes: start, stop, and step. To intercept slice operations, you need to check if the argument passed to __getitem__() is a slice object, and if so, you can return a new object that represents the slice.\n",

If the argument passed to __getitem__() is a slice object, we extract the start, stop, and step attributes of the slice object and return a new MyList object that represents the slice of the original list. If the argument is an integer, we return the corresponding element of the original list."

    "Q5. When is it appropriate to use operator overloading?\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator overloading is appropriate when the objects of a class represent some kind of abstract entity or concept that has some predefined mathematical or logical behavior. For example, if a class represents a complex number or a vector, it might make sense to overload the arithmetic operators such as +, -, *, /, etc. Similarly, if a class represents a container or a sequence of items, it might make sense to overload the indexing operator [] or the slicing operator [:]. Operator overloading can make the code more readable and intuitive, and can allow the programmer to use the built-in language constructs in a natural way. However, operator overloading should be used judiciously and only when it makes sense for the particular class and its intended use cases. Overusing operator overloading can make the code harder to read and understand, and can lead to unexpected and unintuitive behavior."
