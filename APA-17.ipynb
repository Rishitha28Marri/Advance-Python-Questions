    "\n",
    "In regular expressions, greedy syntax matches as much input as possible, while non-greedy syntax matches as little as possible. To transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one, simply add a ? after the quantifier. For example, .* is a greedy pattern that matches everything, while .*? is a non-greedy pattern that matches as little as possible."

The main purpose of using a non-tagged group is to group together parts of a regular expression so that you can apply a repetition or other operation to them. If you are not doing any operation on the group, using a non-tagged group has no significant effect."

    "\n",
    "Using a nontagged category can have a significant impact on a program's outcomes when performing complex regex operations. For instance, suppose we want to extract all the HTML tags from an HTML document using regex. We can use a regex pattern like <.*?> to extract all the HTML tags. However, this pattern is greedy and matches the entire HTML document instead of individual tags. To extract individual tags, we can use a nontagged category like <[^>]*> instead. This pattern matches everything between < and >, excluding any other > symbols within the match. Using this pattern ensures that we extract only individual tags, rather than the entire document."

    "Q5. Unlike a normal regex pattern, a look-ahead condition does not consume the characters it examines. Describe a situation in which this could make a difference in the results of your programme.\n",
    "\n",
    "A look-ahead condition in a regex pattern is used to ensure that a certain pattern exists ahead of the current matching position without including it in the match itself. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to match a specific pattern but only if it is followed by another specific pattern. For example, suppose you have a string that contains a list of names and phone numbers, separated by commas. You want to extract only the phone numbers that are followed by the word \"home\". You can use a look-ahead assertion to check if the word \"home\" appears after the phone number without including it in the match itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, using a look-ahead condition instead of a normal regex pattern can make a significant difference in the program's results because it allows you to filter out unwanted matches without including them in the final output. Without the look-ahead condition, you would need to extract all phone numbers and then filter out the ones that are not followed by the word \"home\", which could be more time-consuming and less efficient."

    "In regular expressions, both positive look-ahead and negative look-ahead are used to specify a pattern to match only if it is followed by another specific pattern. The main difference between positive and negative look-ahead is that positive look-ahead matches the pattern if it is followed by the specified pattern, whereas negative look-ahead matches the pattern only if it is not followed by the specified pattern.\n",

One thing that the Scanner interface does that the re.findall feature in Python does not is that it allows you to easily parse different types of data from a string, such as integers or floating-point numbers, by providing methods like nextInt() and nextDouble(). In contrast, re.findall simply returns a list of all non-overlapping matches in the string, without any special handling of the data type."
