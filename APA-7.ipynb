    "Q1. What is the purpose of the try statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the try statement in Python is to define a block of code that might raise an exception when executed, and to specify the actions that should be taken if an exception is raised. The try statement is usually followed by one or more except clauses that define the exception types that the block of code may raise, and the code to be executed in case an exception of that type is raised. The try statement may also be followed by a finally clause, which specifies code that should be executed in any case, whether an exception was raised or not."

    "try-except block: This block is used to handle exceptions. Code that may raise an exception is put in the try block, and the response to the exception is handled in the except block.\n",
    "try-finally block: This block is used to ensure that a section of code is always executed, whether an exception is raised or not. Code that must be executed regardless of whether an exception is raised is placed in the finally block."

    "When used without an argument, it simply re-raises the current exception that is being handled in the except block.\n",

    "\n",
    "The assert statement is used to check whether a condition is true, and raise an AssertionError exception if it is not true. It is similar to the if statement, but it is used to check conditions that should always be true, rather than making decisions based on conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assert statement takes the form assert condition, message, where condition is the expression that is being checked, and message is an optional string that will be printed if the assertion fails. If condition is false, an AssertionError exception is raised with the specified message."
