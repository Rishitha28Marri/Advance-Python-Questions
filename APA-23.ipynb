    "Q2. Can you explain the benefit of compound interest over a higher rate of interest that does not compound after reading this chapter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Compound interest is the addition of interest to the principal amount, which then earns interest on both the principal and the added interest. Over time, the effect of compounding can be significant and can result in a much larger return on investment compared to a higher rate of interest that does not compound. This is because with compound interest, the interest earned in each period is added to the principal, and then interest is earned on the new total. Over time, this exponential growth can result in a substantial increase in the value of an investment. In contrast, with a higher rate of interest that does not compound, the interest is only earned on the original principal and does not grow exponentially over time. Therefore, compound interest can be a powerful tool for increasing wealth and achieving long-term financial goals."
