    "Q1. What are the two latest user-defined exception constraints in Python 3.X?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.x allows users to define their own exceptions using the raise statement. Two of the latest user-defined exception constraints in Python 3.x are:\n",
    "\n",
    "TimeoutError: This exception is raised when a specific operation or function times out before completing. It is commonly used in network programming, where an operation must complete within a specified time frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "FileNotFoundError: This exception is raised when a file or directory is not found at the specified path. It is commonly used in file handling operations, where a program attempts to access a file that does not exist."

    "Q2. How are class-based exceptions that have been raised matched to handlers?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, when an exception is raised, the interpreter looks for an appropriate exception handler to handle the exception. If a matching exception handler is not found, the interpreter propagates the exception up the call stack until it reaches the top-level of the program, where it is typically handled by the default exception handler and an error message is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class-based exception is raised, Python searches for an exception handler by looking for an except statement that specifies the exception class in its except clause. If a matching except statement is found, the block of code associated with that except statement is executed."

    "Q3. Describe two methods for attaching context information to exception artefacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is raised in a program, it can sometimes be difficult to determine the exact cause of the error without additional context information. Fortunately, Python provides several methods for attaching context information to exception artifacts, which can help make debugging and error handling easier. Here are two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the args attribute: When defining a custom exception class, you can include additional arguments that provide context information about the exception. These arguments can be accessed using the args attribute of the exception instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the with_traceback() method: The with_traceback() method of an exception instance can be used to attach context information to the traceback of the exception. The traceback is a record of the call stack at the time the exception was raised, and it can be used to determine the sequence of function calls that led up to the error."

    "Q4. Describe two methods for specifying the text of an exception object&#39;s error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating custom exception objects in Python, it is important to provide a clear and informative error message that helps to identify the cause of the exception. There are several methods for specifying the text of an exception object's error message. Here are two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the __str__ method: The __str__ method is a special method in Python that is called when an object is converted to a string. By defining this method in a custom exception class, you can control the error message that is displayed when the exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using format strings: Another method for specifying the text of an exception object's error message is to use format strings. Format strings allow you to insert variables or values into a string using placeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just two methods for specifying the text of an exception object's error message. Depending on your specific use case, you may choose to use other methods such as concatenation, interpolation, or string formatting functions like str.format(). The important thing is to provide a clear and informative error message that helps to identify the cause of the exception."

    "Q5. Why do you no longer use string-based exceptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited information: String-based exceptions provide limited information about the cause of the error. They do not include any traceback information or context information that can help to identify the location of the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incompatible with try-except blocks: String-based exceptions cannot be caught using the except statement in a try-except block. Instead, they must be caught using a catch-all except block, which can make it difficult to distinguish between different types of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Harder to maintain: String-based exceptions are harder to maintain and modify than class-based exceptions. When using class-based exceptions, you can add new exception classes with additional context information or error handling logic without affecting existing code. With string-based exceptions, you must manually search for and replace all instances of the string throughout your codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Less flexible: String-based exceptions are less flexible than class-based exceptions. With class-based exceptions, you can define custom attributes and methods that provide additional context information or error handling logic. String-based exceptions do not allow for this level of customization."
